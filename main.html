	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to run, as a function of the size of its input. An efficient algorithm is one that has a low time complexity.</p>
<p>Space complexity is a measure of how much memory an algorithm uses, as a function of the size of its input. An efficient algorithm is one that has a low space complexity.</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory space an algorithm uses to store its data and variables. It is typically expressed as a function of the size of the input data. For example, an algorithm that stores all of its input data in an array would have a space complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input data.</p>
